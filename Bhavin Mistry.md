Interview Metadata

Date: Jan 22, 2026[^1]

Interviewee: Bhavin Mistry (MSCS student at NJIT, full-time IC audit professional pivoting to SWE)[^1]

Interviewer: Arjun[^1]

Context: Casual call where Bhavin shared his career pivot story from auditing to tech/SWE via grad school; Arjun (SWE at Lidos defense company) sought advice on masters (esp. AI) and shared his background.[^1]

Key topics covered:[^1]

- Pivoting from non-tech (audit) to SWE via CS masters
- Grad school apps with low undergrad GPA
- Time management for full-time work + async classes + gym
- Networking and job hunting in tough market
- Certifications, personal statements, LORs for apps
- Future plans (MBA in 30s)

Executive Takeaways (read this first)[^1]

- For SWEs already in tech, specialize in AI masters over general CS to boost resume without full pivot.[^1]
- Overcome low undergrad GPA via certs (CompTIA Security+, AWS Cloud Practitioner), full-time experience, and targeted personal statements.[^1]
- Prioritize manager LORs over professors if possible, as daily work vouching carries weight.[^1]
- Network aggressively for referrals to bypass tough job market; aim for internships even while full-time.[^1]
- Block async lectures in calendar and study at library/cafe for intention and fewer distractions vs. home.[^1]
- Full-time work + 2 classes/semester (10hr/wk expected) is manageable with gym if scheduled tightly.[^1]
- Use grad certificate programs (e.g., NJIT) as low-risk entry to full MSCS if top schools reject.[^1]
- Long-term: Masters overshadows undergrad GPA for future MBA/management/entrepreneurship.[^1]

Interviewee Background \& Career Path[^1]

Current role \& scope: Full-time IC audit at firm auditing banks' tech (admin access reviews, transaction systems, security risks); "super boring... checking off a checklist all day."[^1]

Previous roles: Undergrad at Rutgers (Information \& Computer Science? dual major; CS GPA 2.4 due to skipping classes, IC 3.5, overall ~2.8).[^1]

Key pivots / inflection points: Rejected from Georgia Tech cybersecurity MS; entered NJIT grad certificate (4 CS classes → auto MSCS); plans MBA in 30s for management/own thing once established.[^1]

Skills they credit most for advancement: Networking for referrals; time management (calendar blocking, library study); certs + full-time exp to offset GPA.[^1]

Schooling \& certifications: Rutgers undergrad; NJIT MSCS (2 classes/sem, async, aiming 1.5-2 yrs); CompTIA Security+, AWS Cloud Practitioner.[^1]

Detailed Notes by Theme

Career strategy \& promotions[^1]

- Main points: Pivot via CS masters to "rewrite myself"; specialize if already SWE (AI for Arjun); masters for jobs, GPA fix, learning CS fundamentals.[^1]
- Frameworks: No formal; long-term stack (masters now → MBA later).[^1]
- Concrete examples: NJIT cert → MSCS; applying summer internships + full-time roles to exit audit by Oct.[^1]
- What this means for me: Consider AI masters to specialize/de-risk resume; use current SWE exp + manager LORs; network for Lidos internships.[^1]

Learning strategy (certs, degree, self-study)[^1]

- Main points: Certs offset low GPA; personal projects + full-time exp key in apps.[^1]
- Frameworks: None explicit.[^1]
- Concrete examples: CompTIA Sec+, AWS Cloud Prac for Georgia Tech app (rejected but helped NJIT).[^1]
- What this means for me: Stack AI-relevant certs if pursuing U Penn; leverage Lidos exp over prof LORs.[^1]

Switching teams/roles[^1]

- Main points: Networking builds referral pipeline; tough market but connections ensure interviews.[^1]
- Frameworks: None.[^1]
- Concrete examples: Connections at companies for role alerts/referrals.[^1]
- What this means for me: Offer Bhavin Lidos referral; expand my network via him for defense/tech.[^1]

Work-life balance / sustainability[^1]

- Main points: Work + gym + 2hr study/library daily; home distractions (family) → library for intention.[^1]
- Frameworks: Calendar-block lectures (e.g., Thu 7-9pm); async pros/cons (flex but time mgmt huge).[^1]
- Concrete examples: Lives with 4 grandparents (distractions); 10hr/wk/class expected.[^1]
- What this means for me: Library/cafe for U Penn async to match; block time around gym.[^1]

Advice \& Principles[^1]

- "For you [SWE] it makes total sense to go into AI... specialized degree like AI."[^1]
- No right/wrong; tailor to story (CS pivot for me, specialize for you).[^1]
- Time management huge for async; change space (library) adds intention.[^1]
- Manager LOR > prof if possible (daily vouching).[^1]
- Network now for referrals even in tough market.[^1]

Best Quotes (verbatim)[^1]

- "I need comp science to kind of like rewrite myself."[^1]
- "Its super boring. Like I just like I just like look at evidence all day and like its like kind of like checking off a checklist."[^1]
- "Time management is huge."[^1]
- "Going to the library... adds more um like intention... if Im going to the library, I know Im studying."[^1]
- "What Ive been doing is like networking... push my name up to like the recruiter."[^1]
- "The reason Im doing my masters is like one for a better job, two to kind of overshadow that [GPA] and three also just to learn."[^1]
- "If you have internships plus a full-time, it definitely looks a lot better."[^1]
- "Manager is probably better since youve been working with them every day and they can vouch for you more."[approx][^1]

Action Items for Me (specific and time-bound)[^1]
Do this week:

- Text Bhavin Lidos company details and intern app info.[^1]
- Request his Georgia Tech/NJIT personal statements.[^1]

Do this month:

- Research AI masters programs (e.g., U Penn) LOR reqs; ID 2 managers for asks.[^1]
- Block 1-2 library sessions to test async study routine.[^1]

Do this quarter:

- Network with 3 contacts for AI/ defense referrals; apply 1-2 internships if aligning.[^1]
- List 3 AI-relevant certs to pursue pre-app.[^1]

Opportunities \& Risks Mentioned[^1]

Opportunities to pursue: Lidos summer internships (3 spots on Arjun's team); referrals via networking; NJIT-style cert-to-MS paths; AI specialization for SWEs.[^1]

Skills-to-build shortlist: Time mgmt/calendar blocking, library study habit, certs (AI-focused like AWS ML equiv).[^1]
Networking/visibility plan: Refer Bhavin to Lidos (reciprocate); connect 1-2 alums weekly via LinkedIn for masters/job refs; share updates post-call.[^1]
