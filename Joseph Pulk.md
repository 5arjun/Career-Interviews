Date: January 20, 2026[^1]

Interviewee: Joseph Pulk, Storage Engineer at NetApp/Leidos[^1]

Interviewer: arjun[^1]

Context: You’re applying to master’s programs soon (including a UPenn AI master’s option) and wanted Joseph’s advice on education choices, career direction (AI vs CS), and longer-term leadership goals; you also asked for a letter of recommendation.[^1]

Key topics covered:

- Joseph’s atypical path (college setback → Marine Corps IT → certifications → civilian role).[^1]
- How military-style training built real-world troubleshooting instincts under pressure.[^1]
- Master’s degree value (especially writing/research/structured thinking), even with uneven instruction quality.[^1]
- AI hype cycle vs durable skills; what to learn that stays valuable.[^1]
- “Higher-level” engineering value: debugging, systems thinking, SDLC, architecture/integration decisions.[^1]
- Management + technical credibility (MBA vs technical master’s; business case skills).[^1]
- Building business cases (LOE/BOE) and using them to drive profit/hiring.[^1]
- Current tech job market volatility; parallels to cloud hype/over-corrections.[^1]
- Networking reality: many peers are military background; harder to find pure “civilian” comparison examples.[^1]
- Letter of recommendation + tuition support question (Leidos program mentioned but details unclear).[^1]


## Executive Takeaways (read this first)

- AI is “here to stay,” and workflows will look fundamentally different than they did 10 years ago; the key is adapting rather than resisting.[^1]
- For software careers, the durable advantage shifts toward higher-level skills (debugging, SDLC understanding, architecture/integration decisions), while some lower-level coding tasks may increasingly be delegated to AI tools.[^1]
- A master’s program can meaningfully change how someone reads technical docs and writes/structures information—largely through heavy research and long-form writing.[^1]
- Even if the instruction quality is mixed, the forced repetition of writing/research can still produce a step-change in communication and structured thinking.[^1]
- Getting an AI-focused master’s can function as a “signal” to employers that you’re embracing the future and ready to work with these shifts, even if others are hesitant.[^1]
- AI-related careers can be viewed as multiple layers: infrastructure/operations, model/development/integrations, and the user-facing full-stack layer (plus model training, which Joseph suggested may not be high-paying).[^1]
- If leadership is a long-term goal, pairing technical depth with business/management skill (e.g., MBA or management competencies) can be powerful—especially in environments where LOE/BOE and customer-facing business cases matter.[^1]
- A strong example of leadership impact: building a repeatable business case/line item that can generate profit and justify hiring more people.[^1]
- Don’t over-index on peers struggling in the market; downturns happen cyclically (Joseph compared today’s AI uncertainty to the cloud boom/bust and correction).[^1]
- Joseph agreed to write a letter of recommendation for you.[^1]


## Interviewee Background \& Career Path

Current role \& scope (what they own, what success looks like)

- Joseph is a Storage Engineer at NetApp/Leidos; specific scope/metrics of success weren’t explicitly defined in the transcript.[^1]
- He described deep experience owning/operating servers, storage, and infrastructure (including NetApp-backed virtualization environments) from earlier roles, which he framed as a major differentiator.[^1]

Previous roles (timeline if possible)

- Started college after high school but flunked the first semester; parents stopped paying, prompting a pivot.[^1]
- Joined the Marine Corps to work in IT; attended MOS school with heavy hands-on Cisco/server training (Windows 2000/2003-era).[^1]
- Over ~10 years, accumulated multiple certifications (CCNA/CCNP, CISSP, CEH, JNCIA, NetApp certs including NCDA, VMware cert).[^1]
- Left the Marine Corps with extensive real systems ownership (Exchange, domain controllers, virtualized environments with NetApp storage) and was cold-called for a job as he transitioned out.[^1]
- Completed a master’s described as “software engineering,” focused on managing SDLC and developers.[^1]

Key pivots / inflection points

- College failure → Marine Corps IT path (biggest life/career pivot).[^1]
- Operational responsibility in real-world environments (Iraq context) reinforcing high-stakes troubleshooting and self-reliance.[^1]
- Master’s experience reframing how he writes, reads, and structures technical information despite dissatisfaction with teaching quality.[^1]

Skills they credit most for advancement (technical + soft skills)

- Technical: deep hands-on systems ownership; troubleshooting under constraints; infrastructure fundamentals across servers/storage/virtualization.[^1]
- Career leverage: “a crap load of certifications” plus real ownership experience that made him a low-risk hire.[^1]
- Communication: he strongly emphasized the value of writing quality and structured communication as a differentiator (he cited helping a manager rewrite emails and avoid looking unprofessional).[^1]

Schooling \& certifications (only what was stated)

- Undergrad completed online at an IT-focused school where most coursework was computing-related (e.g., technical writing; history of computing).[^1]
- Master’s program in “software engineering” (term he used), emphasizing SDLC/developer management; he disliked it due to outdated instruction.[^1]
- Certifications mentioned: CCNA, CCNP, CISSP, CEH, JNCIA, NCDA (NetApp), VMware certification.[^1]


## Detailed Notes by Theme

## Career strategy \& promotions

Main points

- Joseph framed the AI vs CS decision as “chasing down the hype cycle,” and acknowledged it’s a difficult, uncertain bet.[^1]
- He advised not to base decisions solely on peers struggling to find jobs; he views the market as cyclical and currently in a “bad time” with companies hesitant due to AI uncertainty.[^1]
- He compared current AI-driven uncertainty to the cloud boom, where companies moved aggressively, then later reversed course after cost realities hit.[^1]

Frameworks / mental models

- Cycles and corrections: tech booms create overreactions (hiring/firing), followed by a correction when organizations realize they still need the work done.[^1]

Concrete examples

- He referenced companies firing then rehiring, emphasizing that “we actually need all those developers” realization can happen after cuts.[^1]

What this means for me

- Treat the master’s choice as a strategic signal + skill-builder, not a guarantee tied to today’s job market conditions.[^1]
- Optimize for adaptable, durable capabilities (systems thinking, execution, communication) that survive hype cycles.[^1]


## Technical depth vs breadth (AI framing)

Main points

- Joseph broke “AI work” into layers: infrastructure/ops (hardware/platform), model/integration development, and full-stack user-facing systems; he suggested each area can support long-term careers.[^1]
- He suggested model-training work may not be high-paying, citing a person he knows doing minimum-wage model training despite a strong math background.[^1]
- He emphasized that even as AI automates parts of coding, higher-level engineering judgment (debugging, SDLC, system integration) remains valuable.[^1]

Frameworks / mental models

- “Stack layers” model: AI isn’t one job—think platform/infrastructure vs application/integrations vs UI/full stack vs training.[^1]

Concrete examples

- He described people using AI in loops: prompt → run generated code → feed back errors → iterate, as an example of workflow change.[^1]

What this means for me

- If you’re leaning toward MLOps / infrastructure-adjacent AI work, your current infra grounding is aligned with the “platform that AI runs on” layer Joseph described.[^1]
- Build comfort explaining what an AI master’s actually teaches and how you’d apply it, since Joseph noted he wouldn’t personally know what’s inside that curriculum.[^1]


## Leadership \& influence (MBA vs technical master’s)

Main points

- Joseph agreed that an MBA + technical background can clearly signal intent toward management while maintaining credibility in a technical industry.[^1]
- He highlighted that leadership in this environment often requires business-case thinking: estimating work, monetizing it, and communicating value to customers.[^1]
- He noted a gap he observed between degree-trained writing/communication habits and leaders without that training, even when those leaders are strong readers/learners.[^1]

Frameworks / mental models

- Business-case loop: LOE/BOE → price/value framing → customer buys → profit → ability to hire/grow capability.[^1]

Concrete examples

- LOE/BOE explained: translate estimated effort into dollars and project value/return for the customer.[^1]
- Example line item: an ACL modification service priced at \$10,000 regardless of actual time; sometimes it took minutes, sometimes days, but it created predictable revenue and enabled hiring.[^1]

What this means for me

- Start practicing “value math” on projects: articulate time saved, risk reduced, and capability gained in terms a manager/customer cares about.[^1]
- If leadership is the goal, develop writing skills and executive-style communication early; Joseph treated this as a career accelerant.[^1]


## Communication (writing, meetings, exec presence)

Main points

- Joseph described the master’s as forcing heavy writing (including very long papers) and research with limited instruction, which changed how he reads manuals and writes technical content.[^1]
- He gave a specific example of coaching a manager’s emails—removing repetition and improving clarity—to avoid looking unprofessional.[^1]
- He implied that formal academic writing “beating it into you” can create lasting improvements in professional communication.[^1]

Frameworks / mental models

- Writing as leverage: clear writing prevents unnecessary reputational damage and increases influence.[^1]

Concrete examples

- A classmate told him his cloud computing brief was “the most information I’ve gained from this entire class,” reflecting both his competence and his critique of the course quality.[^1]

What this means for me

- Choose a master’s program partly based on how much it will strengthen structured writing/research, since that skill transfers directly into leadership.[^1]
- Ask for feedback loops (like Joseph did with the manager’s emails) to improve professional writing faster than “just practicing alone.”[^1]


## Mentorship \& sponsorship

Main points

- Joseph said he doesn’t know many civilians with a similar “degree → job” path because his network is largely military-background peers.[^1]
- He explicitly framed hiring risk: a company asks “why is it worth the risk” to hire someone not proven yet, and suggested proof signals like open-source contributions.[^1]
- He agreed to write you a letter of recommendation.[^1]

Frameworks / mental models

- “De-risking” model: give employers evidence you can deliver (projects, contributions, proof of work), especially when you don’t have the built-in credibility of military experience.[^1]

Concrete examples

- He listed open source contributions and demonstrated work in the field as examples of proof signals.[^1]

What this means for me

- Build a visible portfolio (open-source, write-ups, shipped tools) to reduce perceived hiring risk.[^1]
- Maintain and deepen these mentor relationships (Joseph, Jim, Jeremy), especially for references and navigating internal opportunities.[^1]


## Advice \& Principles (clean list)

- Don’t blindly chase hype cycles; build durable skills that remain valuable when the market swings.[^1]
- Expect AI to change workflows; focus on higher-level engineering judgment rather than only syntax-level coding.[^1]
- A master’s degree can be valuable largely because it forces research and writing discipline, even if teaching quality varies.[^1]
- If leadership is the target, learn to translate technical work into business value using LOE/BOE-style thinking.[^1]
- Don’t anchor career decisions on peers’ job struggles; market conditions are cyclical and often correct after overreactions.[^1]
- To break in without “pre-proven” signals, show proof of work (e.g., open source, concrete contributions).[^1]


## Best Quotes (verbatim)

- “You’re chasing down the hype cycle.”[^1]
- “AI is is is here to stay.”[^1]
- “You’re going to be like automating their automation, right?”[^1]
- “I’m actually struggling with this too, right? … where does where do we go next?”[^1]
- “A master’s program is going to force you to write these long documents… a shit load of papers.”[^1]
- “There’s no way you can come out of that not a different person and with not more knowledge.”[^1]
- “You’re making a statement to your next employer… I’m embracing these new changes.”[^1]
- “Any company that’s looking at you has to say… why is it worth the risk?”[^1]
- “Have you worked on any open source projects?”[^1]
- “Yes. Yeah, I would do that for you.” (re: recommendation letter)[^1]


## Action Items for Me (specific and time-bound)

### Do this week

- Email Joseph to confirm logistics for the recommendation letter (deadline, submission method, programs list, and bullet points he can use).[^1]
- Draft a 1-page “proof of work” addendum for applications: 2–3 projects, impact, links (GitHub, demos), and how you used AI tools responsibly.[^1]
- Write a short paragraph for your essays that uses Joseph’s “statement to the employer” framing: how the AI master’s signals readiness for the future.[^1]


### Do this month

- Build or polish one public artifact that reduces hiring risk (open-source PR, small tool, or a technical blog post showing systems thinking/debugging).[^1]
- Practice LOE/BOE thinking on a real work task: estimate effort saved, quantify impact, and write a short business-case style summary you could share with a manager.[^1]
- Meet with Jeremy (already planned) and explicitly ask what skills/behaviors they associate with leadership readiness in your org.[^1]


### Do this quarter

- Choose a master’s path using a dual filter: (1) alignment to the AI “layer” you want (infra/MLOps vs model-building vs full-stack) and (2) how much it strengthens writing/research/communication.[^1]
- Create a “leadership communication” improvement loop: ask a senior person to review one email/document per month for clarity and executive tone.[^1]
- Investigate Leidos tuition assistance and map eligible schools vs your target programs; decide whether it should influence program selection.[^1]


## Opportunities \& Risks Mentioned

Opportunities to pursue (projects, skills, networking, visibility)

- Position yourself in one of the durable AI layers (infra/ops, integrations, full-stack) rather than betting only on model training.[^1]
- Use a master’s (especially AI-focused) as a market signal of future readiness.[^1]
- Create proof signals (open source, contributions) to reduce hiring risk and improve mobility.[^1]
- Develop business-case fluency (LOE/BOE) to support leadership trajectory and customer-value storytelling.[^1]

Risks/pitfalls to avoid (anti-patterns, career traps)

- Over-optimizing for hype or basing decisions solely on current job-market fear.[^1]
- Assuming development is “going away” soon; Joseph’s view was that companies still need developers and often realize it after cuts.[^1]
- Going into “AI” without being able to clearly articulate what you learned and how you apply it (Joseph explicitly noted he wouldn’t know the curriculum).[^1]
- Ending up in low-paid model-training work unintentionally (he implied it may not be a strong long-term value path).[^1]

## Follow-up Questions

Questions I should ask the interviewee next time

- When you say “AI degree,” which specific skills/courses do you think matter most for the infra/ops vs integration/dev vs full-stack layers?
- For leadership at NetApp/Leidos, what behaviors get someone seen as “ready” (writing, customer communication, delivering projects, mentoring)?[^1]
- What would you include in a strong recommendation letter for me—what evidence/proof would make it compelling?[^1]
- Can you share one example of a junior engineer who progressed quickly in this environment, and what they did differently?

Questions I should ask other people

- Ask Jim and Jeremy: In the next 2–3 years, which AI-adjacent roles/projects will be most valuable internally (MLOps, automation, platform work, governance)?[^1]
- Ask HR/manager: Exact details of Leidos tuition assistance (eligible schools, reimbursement caps, grade requirements, service commitment).[^1]
