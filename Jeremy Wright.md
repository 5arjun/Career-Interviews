Interviewee: Jeremy Wright – DevSecOps Architect[^1]
Interviewer: Arjun
Context: Career conversation about Jeremy’s non-traditional path, AI vs CS vs MBA, specialization, and leadership.[^1]

Key topics covered

- Long career on one Navy account through multiple contractor changes[^1]
- Self-taught path from help desk to architect[^1]
- AI vs CS master’s vs MBA[^1]
- AI’s impact on jobs and entry-level roles[^1]
- Specialization vs being pigeonholed[^1]
- Recommendation and staying at Leidos while in school[^1]


## Executive Takeaways

- Jeremy built his career by staying on one Navy account, moving from tier-one help desk to architect as companies changed around the contract.[^1]
- He is fully self-taught and sees hands-on learning as the core of his advancement.[^1]
- He views AI as a “next internet” type shift that is here to stay and a strong area to specialize in, though it will be crowded.[^1]
- He thinks a generic CS master’s is less differentiating now, given the surplus of CS grads.[^1]
- For leadership goals, he sees an MBA as broadly useful and compatible with continued coding and AI specialization.[^1]
- He expects AI to supplement junior roles (help desk, junior coders) but still require senior people to design, train, and check AI systems.[^1]
- He frames specialization using supply and demand: it pays when few people have the skill, not when everyone piles in.[^1]
- If starting over, he would likely pursue business (MBA) plus self-taught technical learning.[^1]
- He is supportive of you, calls you an asset, encourages part-time school while staying at Leidos, and agreed to write a recommendation letter.[^1]


## Interviewee Background \& Path

- Current: DevSecOps architect on a Navy network/account, supporting this customer since 2001.[^1]
- Path: Level-one service desk → service desk lead → field services → directory services → architect over ~25 years.[^1]
- Companies changed “five or more times,” but he moved with the contract each time.[^1]
- No formal degree; entirely self-taught through on-the-job learning and personal experimentation.[^1]


## Key Themes (Condensed)

### AI, degrees, and specialization

- AI: transformative like the internet; he believes it will change how humans work and is a safe long-term bet.[^1]
- CS master’s: risks being generic amid a surplus of CS graduates.[^1]
- MBA: broad, opens many doors, and can be combined with AI via certifications and self-study.[^1]
- Specialization: valuable when few people know the tech; once many pile into AI, you must differentiate further.[^1]

**What this means for you**

- If you choose AI, plan to stand out (domain focus, strong projects, or AI + business).[^1]
- An MBA later (or now) plus AI/ML certs and projects can align with your leadership ambitions while keeping you technical.[^1]


### AI and jobs

- AI will likely reduce the number of junior roles (service desk, entry-level coding) but will not remove the need for senior engineers.[^1]
- There will be strong demand for people who understand model behavior and how to train models for specific business needs.[^1]

**What this means for you**

- Aim for roles where you design and oversee AI systems, not just execute routine tasks.[^1]
- Build skills in model training, evaluation, and alignment with mission requirements.[^1]


### Career strategy \& environment

- Strategy: stay close to the customer/mission; let companies rotate while you remain a constant.[^1]
- He values your plan to stay at Leidos while doing school part-time and sees you as a “good asset.”[^1]

**What this means for you**

- Continue building deep context on the Navy account while you study.[^1]
- Look for internal opportunities that push you toward AI/automation or security within this environment.[^1]
